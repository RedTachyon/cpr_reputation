# Reputation to Avert Violence and Tragedy of the Commons in Common Pool Resource Problems

_By Quinn Dougherty, Ben Greenberg, & Ariel Kwiatkowski from the AI Safety Camp 5_ 

## Abstract

A common pool resource problem (CPR) is a special case of a sequential social dilemma of study in public economics. A tragedy of the commons scenario in a CPR is when the resource is exhausted - everyone is incentivized to approppriate the resource, and no one can unilaterally act to bring about sustainability. Prior work on modeling CPRs in multi-agent reinforcement learning averted resource exhaustion through effective privatization. We think reputation systems can be utilized to teach sustainable policies.
